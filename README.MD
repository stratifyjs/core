# Stratify

**Stratify** is an architectural framework built on [**Fastify**](https://fastify.dev/) that introduces clear structural boundaries and a robust **Dependency Injection** system.
Applications are defined through **modules, providers, controllers, hooks, installers, and adapters**, while maintaining Fastify’s performance and encapsulation model.

The suffix _-ify_ acknowledges its Fastify heritage, and _strata_ expresses its guiding principle of modular layering and clear separation of concerns.

Stratify remains fully compatible with the Fastify ecosystem.

> Early stage: open to community feedback as the API matures toward stability by late 2025.
